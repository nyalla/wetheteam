## Inspiration to form We:

“Any human crisis recorded in history so far has always triggered the technological and sociological advancement of human civilization. So every adversity is an opportunity to learn, grow and evolve”



We were presented with the choice to be bitter or better; We chose to be ‘better’ engineers & have come together to form ‘We, (The IT people)’.
